By blurring the lines, Elixir (and the BEAM VM) enable some very powerful and useful meta-programming techniques.</p>\n\n<p>In this presentation, Marten will talk about running and generating code at compile-time, Elixir's hygienic macros, and how to compile and hot-reload altered or extra code, while your program is running!\nBesides explaining these concepts, their usefulness will be motivated using various practical real-world examples.</p>",
