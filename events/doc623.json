  "abstract": "strace is known to add significant overhead to any application it traces.\nEven when users are interested in a handful of syscalls, strace will by\ndefault intercept all syscalls made by the observed processes, involving\nseveral context switches per syscall.  Since strace v5.3, the\n<code>--seccomp-bpf</code> option allows reducing this overhead, by stopping observed\nprocesses only at syscalls of interest.  This option relies on seccomp-bpf\nand inherits a few of its limitations.\n\nIn this talk, we will describe the default behavior of ptrace and strace,\nto understand the problem <code>--seccomp-bpf</code> addresses.  We will then detail\nthe inner workings of the new option, as seen from ptrace (seccomp-stops)\nand bpf (syscall matching algorithms).  Finally, we'll discuss limitations\nof the new option and avenues for improvement.",
