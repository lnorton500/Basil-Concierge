  "description": "The current state of play to protect data is a tedious task that involves many stakeholders and blocks resources.\nThe shift from on-premise to private/public cloud systems requires a careful inspection of an assumed threat model.\nThe application of a zero-trust model is one radical shift to authenticate and authorize at any given point in your\nIT landscape, but most importantly it breaks with the assumption that we can design systems that are \"safe and secure\".\nThe talk will highlight the above mentioned concepts and will give a brief outline of a new approach called Named Data\nNetwork (NDN) and how this could improve the situation in terms of data sovereignty.",
