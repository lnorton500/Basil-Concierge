  "abstract": "<p>In this half hour we study aspects of physically and cryptographically secure hardware (often termed secure element or SE) and the integration into existing circuits. We illustrate utility of such integration by inspecting a cryptocurrency wallet design, and explain the difficulty presented by nondisclosure agreements (NDA) common to industry closed adversaries. We examine several hardware devices, study their parts under a close range circuit camera, and suggest instructions on their use.</p>",
