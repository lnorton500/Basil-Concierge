  "track": "Free Software Radio",
  "abstract": "<p>GNU Radio's value comes from many things, but one of them is a vast library of blocks, both in-tree and out-of-tree. Right now, it is hard to use these blocks in a different context than GNU Radio itself or interface with blocks automatically or programmatically.</p>",
  "description": "<p>A python-based tool that can interact with GNU Radio block headers written in C++, to automatically parse them and extract information about them such as which getters/setters they have, their I/O signatures, factory signatures, etc. GRModtool can be extended with the parsing tool as one of its utilities. The parsed information can be further used for creating YAML files for the GRC.</p>",
