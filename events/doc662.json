  "abstract": "<p>Most of the websites leak out the user data, and most of the times (~90%) it is not known to the site admins. These leakage happen via tag managers, third party CDNs, embeds, fonts etc. In this talk I would like to discuss the opportunities for developers to avoid these while developing websites. This talk will help them to ensure their websites does exactly what they intend their website to do. The side-effect of this always is better performance \ud83d\ude0e</p>",
