Graffiti was created from scratch to provide the features required by Skydive : distributed, replicated, store the whole history of the graph, allow subcribing to events on the graph using WebSocket and visualization.</p>",
  "description": "<p>Skydive (https://skydive.network) is an open source analysis tool. It collects information about an infrastructure topology - such as network interfaces, Linux bridges, network namespaces, containers, virtual machines, ... and store them into a graph database called Graffiti (https://github.com/skydive-project/skydive/tree/master/graffiti)</p>\n\n<p>The graph is :</p>\n\n<pre><code>- distributed : some agents only have a portion of the graph\n- replicated : for high availability and load distribution\n- historical : every change on the graph is archived, allowing retrieval of the graph at any point in time or getting all the revisions of a set of nodes and edges during a period of time\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A custom implementation of the Gremlin language is used to query the graph, with some additional steps to specify the time context of the query for instance.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the core engine, a WebSocket based user interface - based on D3JS - is available to visualize and interact with the graph.</p>\n\n<p>This presentation will showcase a demo of Graffiti and try to advocate its use in your own project.</p>",
