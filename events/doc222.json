  "abstract": "Oreboot = Coreboot - C. Oreboot is a fully open-source power-on-reset and romstage firmware written in Rust. Oreboot can boot a HiFive RISC-V processor to Linux with a Go user-mode.\n\nOreboot rethinks the firmware driver models. Each driver is distilled to four basic functions: init, pread, pwrite and shutdown. This interface allows us to make convenient higher-level drivers such as a \"union driver\" which duplicates a single write operation to multiple drivers. This makes consoles which have multiple underlying UART drivers elegant.\n\nBy using the Rust programming language, Oreboot has a leg-up in terms of security and reliability compared to contemporary firmware written in C or assembly. Rust's borrow-checker ensures pointers are not used after freed and proves that coroutines are thread-safe at compile time.\n\nIn this talk, we will also present a short overview of the basics of Rust, how our driver model incorporates coroutines and the bootflow of Oreboot.",
