That software has given us, the human a new superpower which is the power of artificial neural networks. The goal of those networks is to help us answer the question : \u201cGiven X, predict Y with Z% accuracy\u201d. This is where Deep Learning comes into picture. Let\u2019s build a basic building block of deep learning :  neural network.</p>",
