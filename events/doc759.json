  "description": "<p>Building a community around your company\u2019s open source project is no easy task, and there is no magic bullet or one size fits all solution. However, there are some things that you can do (or not do) to increase the chances of successfully building a community for your project.</p>\n\n<p>A few of the dos and don\u2019ts covered in this talk include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Planning and product management: Do use a transparent process in the open with tools that allow anyone to participate. Don\u2019t use your internal tools and private meetings to make all of the decisions.</li>\n<li>Encourage participation: Do be proactive about helping community members contribute in meaningful ways. Don\u2019t inadvertently set the expectation that employees will be the ones always answering questions and making decisions.</li>\n<li>Be honest: Do be honest with yourselves about where and how you prefer to have community members contribute. Don\u2019t encourage people to contribute in areas where you are less likely to accept outside contributions.</li>\n<li>Managing contributions: Do have enough people trained in how to provide constructive feedback to manage the flow of incoming community contributions. Don\u2019t assume that your existing developers have the time and skills to magically perform this difficult function.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>The audience will walk away with practical advice about building communities for corporate open source projects.</p>",
