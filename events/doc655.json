How are we making it a smooth usage for those with disabilities, for those with reduce time and internet connection? Or even more further, for those that just use the web for the first time?\nLet's learn a bit how the devtools from Firefox can help us improve everyone's experience without much of a sacrifice on our end.",
  "description": "A11y and inclusion is getting more traction nowadays but people still think that they address only those with disabilities. As a person without any officially i did find myself in this situation and felt confused about how the web should be ( was about to loose money on ticket conferences because i was not seeing the categories). Some Developers are a bit defensive saying they don't have users for whom to build more a11y in or the time to add these features. Showing the devtools Firefox has for it - will show how fast you can check your page and how no costy is. Also not knowing all best practices won't be a blocker and firefox will give you suggestions. In a way i wanted to bring attention to A11y nd Inclusion in a more technical way.",
