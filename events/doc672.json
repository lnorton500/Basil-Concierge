  "abstract": "<p>Recently there has been tremendous interest in P2P systems and their usefulness. However most people are confused about how they work, how nodes are techno-magically able to find each other or the right other node with expected data. This talk would start p2p from basics, it's differences with client-server systems and then different ways p2p systems can operate, dhts as one way. And then end with more specific things as kademlia being a good dht and how does it work. It would be interesting because it (kademlia) powers some of the most popular p2p systems such as bittorrent, IPFS, Ethereum, I2P, Tox etc.</p>",
