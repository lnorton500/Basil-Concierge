  "abstract": "<p>Open source stacks such as GStreamer, ffmpeg and UPipe now implement a large number of different ways to stream audio &amp; video over a network. Just to name a few, there are RTSP, SRT, RIST, WebRTC, HLS, DASH, AES67, SmoothStreaming, RTMP! Some are for local networks and some target the Internet, depending on the use-case, these protocols have different upsides and downsides. To create a successful project, one needs to select the best suited technology. I'll go over the various protocols and explain how they relate to each other and their individual advantages and inconveniences.</p>",
