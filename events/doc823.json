  "description": "Zyre has the potential to change the cloud paradigm, with auto-discovery inside the LAN, and without any requirement of an internet connectivity.\n\nYour TV can then discover your fridge.\n\n3 years ago, I was working with Pieter Hintjens, main author of ZeroMQ and organiser of the IOT devroom, on a demo setup for his last conference at IOT Munich.\n\nWhen he came back from Munich, he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.\n\nWe demonstrated a pile of OpenWRT routers blinking LED lamps in an orchestrated way.\n\nMost of my work included assembling the hardware, writing OpenWRT packages, making a CI/CD for the devices.\n\nI will show how to build OpenWRT packages with new cluster technologies, like Kubernetes.",
