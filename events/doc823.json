  "description": "<p>Zyre has the potential to change the cloud paradigm, with auto-discovery inside the LAN, and without any requirement of an internet connectivity.</p>\n\n<p>Your TV can then discover your fridge.</p>\n\n<p>3 years ago, I was working with Pieter Hintjens, main author of ZeroMQ and organiser of the IOT devroom, on a demo setup for his last conference at IOT Munich.</p>\n\n<p>When he came back from Munich, he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.</p>\n\n<p>We demonstrated a pile of OpenWRT routers blinking LED lamps in an orchestrated way.</p>\n\n<p>Most of my work included assembling the hardware, writing OpenWRT packages, making a CI/CD for the devices.</p>\n\n<p>I will show how to build OpenWRT packages with new cluster technologies, like Kubernetes.</p>",
