In general it will show current progress in the project and main pain points. One of the goals of the presentation is to solicit some help from the community. Maintainers are quite busy and they are not able to solve all issues themselves. So, help from others is greatly appreciated. At the end of presentation Q&amp;A session is planned.</p>",
