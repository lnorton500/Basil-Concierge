  "abstract": "<p>According to the interwebs, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the multiverse.<br/>\nAnd yet, when it comes to games, its popularity seems to dwindle.</p>\n\n<p>Why though...<br/>\nIs it really not suited for game development?<br/>\nIs the language as bad as the critics claim??<br/>\nIs GC...EVIL!?</p>\n\n<p>I have this side-project of porting Doom 3 from C/C++ to Java. And even though Doom 3 is a ~15 year old game, it is still a massive AAA code-base. So I believe my experiences there can adequately answer a lot of the questions that come to mind when you think of Java &amp; Games.</p>\n\n<p>During this talk, I will try to convince you that Java is a very viable game prototyping/development tool.<br/>\nEither that, or will add more fuel to the flame...</p>",
