This presentation will give an overview of how code reviews are used to manage release activity. It will step through the use of Zuul CI jobs to perform validation of requests before they are accepted, and how commits are used to trigger jobs to tag and release the software, update documentation, trigger requirements updates, and other follow on work that needs to happen whenever new code is released.</p>",
