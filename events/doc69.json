Memory recycling of received buffers achieved through\nthe in kernel page<em>pool API plays a fundamental role in the increased performance.\nAdding XDP support on a driver can be non-trivial. In this talk we'll demonstrate\nhow porting a standard ethernet driver (mvneta/netsec) to XDP and the page</em>pool API can\nboost performance.\nPart of the page_pool evolution involves adding the recycling support\nin the kernel's SKB stack and leverage the increased performance\nattributes of the API.",
