  "abstract": "A lot of open source developers choose to deploy their software on infrastructure based on proprietary software. Behind this apparent paradox is the need to adapt to changing environments, adopt new technologies fast, and use increasing amounts of computing power. Open infrastructure (computing, networking and storage infrastructure based on open source software) has a lot to offer, but it's easy to overlook if you don't take the time to take a step back and analyze the situation rationally. In this talk, Thierry Carrez, VP of Engineering at the OSF, explains all the reasons why open infrastructure matters, and why it makes sense for you to adopt it today.",
  "description": "Outline of this talk:\n\n\nInfrastructure (what do we mean by infrastructure, and why it matters in the general evolution of computing)\nOpen (key benefits of using open source software in general, and openly-developed community-led projects in particular)\nCapabilities, Compliance and Cost (extra benefits of using open source software for providing infrastructure)\nInteroperability (benefits of using the same open source projects across providers)\nFuture-proof (open source allows to invest in adaptive communities rather than static products)\nEnabling innovation everywhere (infrastructure should not be only provided by a couple of Internet giants like Amazon and Google)\n",
