  "description": "<p>Back in 2018, we started implementing a small prototype for indoor tracking using inexpensive and compact Espressif ESP32 devices. Beaconing and scanning at the same time, results are transmitted using MQTT for real time analysis and recording.</p>\n\n<p>The first results looked promising and shifted the focus towards user-experience (UX) and visualization. An Angular client allows accessing data in real-time, utilizing a distributed on-site network integrated into the cloud. On-site, UX also concerns the rapid tactical deployment of mesh networks utilizing various links (IEEE 802.3 / 802.11, ITU G.992.5 aka DSL).</p>\n\n<p>The initial deployment happened in September 2019. It has demonstrated the general feasibility and outlined the room for a lot of UI an UX improvements, from which the need for expertise and new contributors has arisen.</p>\n\n<p>Let's have a look at the challenges we encountered building the network and see, why it's exciting to build an IoT-network to be used in the field. We would like to invite you to work with us and welcome some networking later on.</p>",
