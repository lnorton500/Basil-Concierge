  "abstract": "CadQuery (CQ) [1] is a Python library for building of parametric 3D models. The overarching\ndesign goal is to be extremely fluent and as close as possible to the design intent. CQ is based on\nthe open source CAD kernel from OpenCascade and therefor offers industry standard B-Rep\nmodeling capabilities and allows exporting to lossless formats such as STEP as well as lossy ones\nsuch as STL. Originally it used Python bindings based on FreeCAD [2] but recently we switched to\nPythonOCC [3] to be more flexible and have full access to the underlying CAD kernel capabilities.\nIn the talk I will summarize the current status of the CQ project, show some interesting\nusage examples and discuss newly implemented features. Furthermore I will elaborate on the future\nplans of the core development team and touch on some of the challenges of maintaining a project\nsuch as CQ. I will also present a fairly new addition to the CQ ecosystem \u2013 CQ-editor [3]. It is a\nPython/PyQt5 based lightweight cross-platform GUI editor that allows to quickly develop and\npreview CQ 3D models. It also offers graphical debugging and CQ stack introspection capabilities\nwhich dramatically lowers the entry barrier for trying out and using CQ.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery\n[2] https://www.freecadweb.org\n[3] https://github.com/tpaviot/pythonocc-core\n[4] https://github.com/CadQuery/CQ-editor",
