  "abstract": "In this talk we will explore some of the FOSS specific mentalities and\npractices that may discourage adoption of comprehensive automated testing, and\npresent advice for promoting and sustaining automated testing in FOSS projects.",
  "description": "Automated testing is on the rise in the FOSS world, but there is still ample\nroom for improvement when it comes to sufficiently comprehensive automated\ntests. The test suites of many FOSS projects leave a lot to be desired,\na result that's often affected by useful FOSS practices that are\ntaken too far. Identifying such practices, like placing excessive trust in code\nreviews because \"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\", or leaving tests\nfor later in the spirit of \"release often, release early\", is a first step in\nhaving a discussion that will hopefully convince more projects to embrace\nautomated testing, and improve the quality of FOSS overall.",
