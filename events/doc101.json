  "abstract": "<p>Incorporating new components into PCBs is a difficult task that often requires reading multiple datasheets and creating prototypes to get it right. The funny thing is: every engineer needs to re-read reference designs! Even though there are tens of thousands of designs with new components documented and available on Github. The reason: it is almost impossible to find a relevant project. The solution? Instead of using Github search, which only retrieves files by filename, our approach creates a local database that takes the search results from Github, and then parses the used components inside the PCB designs to index them. That way, you can easily search a component and get the most relevant designs as a reference.</p>\n\n<p>This talk will give an overview of the software that was created, discusses the difficulties that were overcome and the potential for improvement in future work.</p>\n\n<p>Currently 300 of an estimated 30000 KiCad-projects on GitHub have been indexed as a proof-of-concept. We expect the data to be completed at the end of December. The project was kindly supported by AISLER with a server instance. The prototype of the search engine can be accessed at https://search-dev.aisler.net The release candidate should be ready at the end of December with the full dataset.</p>",
