  "abstract": "At the GNU Tools Cauldron we held a panel discussion on how GCC and LLVM can work together. The video of that discussion can be seen at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnbJOSZXynA.\n\nWe proposed a similar discussion to be held at the LLVM Developers Meeting, but the reviewers suggested that such a discussion would be better held as part of the FOSDEM LLVM Devroom, since that was more likely to attract GNU developers as well.\n\nWe wish to explore how Clang/LLVM and the GCC can work together effectively.\n\nThe participants will explore opportunities for co-operation between the projects. Areas to be covered include:\n- collaboration on issues related to language standards, changes to existing standards or implementing new ones;\n- maintaining ABI compatibility between the compilers;\n- interoperability between tools and libraries e.g. building with clang and libstdc++ or building with gcc and linking with lld; and\n- communication channels for developers via bugzilla or mailing lists.\n\nWe hope the output of the discussion will inform future work between the two communities.\n\nThe panelists are yet to be confirmed, but I have invited those who offered to participate at the LLVM Developer Room: Tom Stellard of Red Hat, Nathan Sidwell of Facebook, Iain Sandoe, now independent.  All have been major contributors to GCC and/or LLVM for many years.  I shall act as moderator.",
