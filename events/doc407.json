  "description": "<p>Embedded systems are hard to debug. Complex systems have a lot of variables.\nWhen debugging those systems, we often log data into some files, and visualize\nthem later on, using excel, matplotlib or something else.</p>\n\n<p>This talk is about tracing and logging. What are the options we have as embedded\nsoftware developers? I will present the lognplot tool, a project to plot incoming data\non the fly. There are two implementations, one in python, and one in rust\nwith gtk-rs. The data is stored internally in a zoomable format, allowing\nlarge sets of data to be browsed easily.</p>\n\n<p>During the talk you will learn how to draw a chart, and how to aggregate\nlarge sets of data into summaries.</p>\n\n<p>I will demo a STM32 serial wire viewer output connected to this tool\nto enable live tracing of an embedded system.</p>",
