What are the options we have as embedded\nsoftware developers? I will present the lognplot tool, a project to plot incoming data\non the fly. There are two implementations, one in python, and one in rust\nwith gtk-rs. The data is stored internally in a zoomable format, allowing\nlarge sets of data to be browsed easily.\n\nDuring the talk you will learn how to draw a chart, and how to aggregate\nlarge sets of data into summaries.\n\nI will demo a STM32 serial wire viewer output connected to this tool\nto enable live tracing of an embedded system.",
