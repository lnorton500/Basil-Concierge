  "abstract": "<p>This talk will present the result of our experimentation done at i.Lab Wireless Testbed in Ghent, in the context of <a href=\"https://www.fed4fire.eu/\">FED4Fire+ H2020 project</a>. Our project aims to collect raw radio frequency (RF) signals of widely used radio protocols for Internet of Things (IoT) devices in the 2.4GHz ISM bandwidth, such as Bluetooth Low Energy and LoRa, using software-defined radio (SDR).\nThis will allow us collecting a large, reliable and reproducible dataset of RF fingerprint. This dataset will be further used to develop deep learning algorithms for IoT device fingerprinting and localization. Our use case is the authentication of autonomous vehicles or robots in a building according to their localization, without any over-the-air key exchange algorithm.</p>",
