  "abstract": "This presentation is an introduction of an open source project I have been working on for five years: https://github.com/tsavola/gate.\n\nBuilding on WebAssembly, Gate makes it possible to snapshot running programs and resume them in diverse environments: unlike with other snapshot-and-restore solutions, the snapshots are portable across CPU architectures and operating systems.  Part of the solution is appropriate resource abstraction.  The presentation hopefully includes a quick demonstration of migration of a live program between x86-64 and ARM64 machines.",
  "description": "A subproject of Gate is a specialized WebAssembly compiler implemented in Go: https://github.com/tsavola/wag\n\nGate is at the stage where a proof-of-concept has been implemented; it works.  Its future would greatly benefit from wider community engagement, so I wish to present the project and its ideas to a technical user and developer audience.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Blog article: https://savo.la/introduction-to-gate.html</li>\n<li>Server running Gate: https://www.gate.computer</li>\n<li>Port of DOOM for Gate: https://github.com/tsavola/DOOM/tree/gate</li>\n</ul>",
