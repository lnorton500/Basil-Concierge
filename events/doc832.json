  "description": "<p>In the last decade, Industry 4.0 has emerged as a revolution for the traditional technology, and the Internet of Things (IoT) is at the core of it. Apache, Eclipse and Linux foundations, three of the main actors in Open Source, have put in place their own IoT architectures powered by different Open Source projects. In this talk, these architectures are compared and a common architecture is identified based on emerging standards, with a special focus in the Edge. Then, the common architecture is used to classify the different Open Source projects.</p>\n\n<p>For each project, activity and community analysis based on the data extracted from Git and Github issue trackers is achieved using the GrimoireLab platform, a powerful Open Source tool for software analytics. Finally, the data obtained is used to understand the Open Source IoT landscape in terms of companies involved, leading projects, technologies adopted and communities.</p>\n\n<p>A total of 55 projects have been analyzed and all of them are classified in the categories: Edge, Cloud, Enterprise, Tools. And inside the Edge category, five subcategories are defined: OS and virtualization in devices, communication protocols, data processing, platforms for interoperability and applications. For all the projects the data for the activity (commits) and community size (people doing commits) are extracted and analyzed in time series.</p>\n\n<p>The data will be presented as dashboards that all attendees can consult online and all the data could be shared with interested people for further analysis.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/acslinkedin/\">Alvaro del Castillo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/valerio-cosentino-29980121\">Valerio Cosentino</a></li>\n</ul>",
