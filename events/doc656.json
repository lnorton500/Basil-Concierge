  "description": "As an industry working on the Web, as a platform and set of tools, we recognized a critical voice was missing when it came to making decisions about feature development \u2014 that of web designers and developers.\n\nThe MDN Web Developer Needs Assessment is the first edition of an annual study providing a prioritized list of designer and developer needs.\n\nWe put this report together with the help of more than 30 stakehold- ers from the MDN Product Advisory Board member organizations and the input of more than 28,000 developers and designers from 173 countries who took the twenty minutes necessary to complete the survey entirely. That\u2019s more than 10,000 hours contributed by the community to help us understand their pain points, wants, and needs. With that involvement, we believe the MDN Web DNA is the largest web developer and designer focused research study ever conducted.\n\nTheir input now, and in future versions, will influence how browser vendors prioritize feature development so we can address the needs of designers and developers, both on and off the Web. By producing the report annually, we can track needs and pain points over time so we can see the impact of our efforts.\n\nA critical aspect of the report is that it provides a voice for commu- nities of practitioners. We did not tailor it to current assessments and priorities of participating browser vendors. A single browser vendor does not own it.",
