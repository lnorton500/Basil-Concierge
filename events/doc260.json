It uses the Linux Kernel Library (LKL) and a modified version of musl to provide system support for complex applications within the enclave.  SGX-LKL has support for in-enclave user-level threading, signal handling, and paging. This demo presents an overview of SGX-LKL and demonstrates how popular applications can be ported and executed within SGX-LKL.</p>",
