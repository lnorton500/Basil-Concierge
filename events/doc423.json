  "description": "With tracked controllers, heads and hands, AR and VR introduced the requirement for a new set of user interactions. In this talk you will learn about existing implementations and how the classical UX model with keyboard and mouse translates to these new concepts. I will highlight the technical aspect of these requirements and how they were solved in xrdesktop. Featuring 3D window management and synthesis for traditional input, xrdesktop is a software stack that integrates VR in the GNOME and KDE desktop environments. You will also get an overview of the history and status of Open Source in AR and VR.",
