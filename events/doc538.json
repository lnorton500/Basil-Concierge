  "abstract": "We examine the use of equalizers in wireless communication systems, how these are implemented in GNU Radio, and how the existing GR equalizer functionality can be extended with a new OOT using training-based adaptation.  The theory of multipath channels, ISI, and how to overcome with adaptive equalization will be reviewed and shown with interactive flowgraphs.",
