  "abstract": "Yeah, this is about my last summer. But I promise to focus on the story of how I was able to do four amazing lightning talks with Python and a harmonica.\n\nThis one is not about technical stuff, it is about finding something that python overlaps with your hobbies and sharing it back to the community.",
  "description": "This talk is about writing songs and playing music with python. Back in 2017 I came to know FoxDot, a python wrapper around SuperCollider, which is a super popular open source synthesizer. Since then, I have been using it to create entertaining lighting talks and would like to cover a bit more than just a lightning talk this time.",
