  "description": "<p>After much lawyerly fun, the UEFI Self-Certification Testsuite (SCT) was released under an OSI license (BSD2) at the end of 2018.\nWe will explain why this is useful, and how this has helped with the addition of UEFI support in U-Boot, as well as helped improving EDK2 code quality.</p>\n\n<p>We have a new process, referred to as \"code first\" for drafting changes to the UEFI spefication in public.\nThis will give an overview of the process, as well as one of the first exercises of it - the definition of audio APIs (for accessibility or, you know, DOOM).</p>\n\n<p>Also, an update on changes in the EDK2 reference implementation, including dropping the CLA and upcoming RISC-V support.</p>",
