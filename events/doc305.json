  "abstract": "Every year we hear great content about how to develop in Go, but rarely do we focus on how to test in Go. Well written tests are critical to the success of a project, and more often than not, they can help drive developers to design features in more simple and concise ways.",
  "description": "In this talk, I'll explain the importance of test driven development and provide some tactics for how to implement the practice in your daily work and on your respective team. I'll dive into the testing, require, and assert packages to dissect which function calls are appropriate for different use cases, and present multiple different ways to write Go tests for each scope, including unit, integration and e2e. I'll also discuss how to refactor code to make it more testable (with examples), so you can optimize and simplify Go code for robust and reliable Go tests. Lastly, I will cover race conditions to help you debug concurrency related problems. Let's write Go(od) tests!",
