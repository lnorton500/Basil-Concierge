  "description": "<p>Tracking performance is needed when new functionality is added, to\nbalance the additional services versus the resource increase needed.\nMeasuring and tracking performance is also critical to ensure a new\nrelease can cope with the current or expected load.</p>\n\n<p>We will discuss various aspects such as which tools and techniques\nare used for performance tracking and measurements, what are the\ntraps and pitfalls encountered for these activities.  The application\nin question is using Ada, but most of the items discussed are not\nparticularly Ada related.</p>",
