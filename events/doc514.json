We support open source projects, such as Tahoe-LAFS, Gridsync, Magic Folders and Magic Wormhole. This session presents a design research project, where we investigate file storing/file sharing needs of human rights organisations. As an outcome of this research, we are exploring how we can adapt our open source tools to best meet use cases and usability requirements of human rights organisations. This presentation will focus on the research process and the development of findings with the purpose of making open source tools available to meet human rights organizations\u2019 needs. The project is funded by the Open Technology Fund.",
