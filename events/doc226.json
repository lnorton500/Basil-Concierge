  "description": "<p>Alpha Waves is the first 3D platform game ever, according to the Guiness Book of Records.</p>\n\n<p>The game was initially developed on Atari ST, representing 17000 lines of 68K assembly code.\nIt was later ported on Atari ST and on the IBM PC, and was the first and only assembly program game that Infogrames ever ported to another CPU.\nThe technology developed for that game later inspired Frederick Raynal to develop Alone in the Dark, a major game that launched Infogrames in the big league.</p>\n\n<p>This talk is the history of that game by its developer. It will cover:\n* General principles of paleo-3D\n* How to draw polygons in software. Fast.\n* Computing 3D transforms using mostly additions\n* Music, graphics and other stuff\n* Funny stories and trivia around the game, including the stints of Infogrames in Artificial Intelligcence and the arch-genesis of Alone in the Dark</p>",
