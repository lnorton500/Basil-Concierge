  "abstract": "<p>Representing geographical time-space is a fundamental issue in geography, addressing core questions of the discipline, i.e. where are places and what distance separate them. Yet, considering the properties of geographical time space shaped by transport means, no satisfying cartographic representation \u2013 including classical maps and plastic space approaches \u2013  has been proposed so far.\nThe \"shriveling_world\" project aims at producing images of the global geographical time-space, using the third dimension, as in time-space relief maps. The word \"shriveling\" was introduced by Waldo Tobler in his comments of Mathis-L'Hostis time-space relief image, in order to describe the complex contraction process suggested by the model.\nThe FOSDEM presentation aims at opening the code to the scientific community, now that the application is close to a first functional version.</p>",
