Including\nKubernetes integration and how CNI was born.</p>\n\n<p>Weave Net is written in Go, using many Linux kernel features such as veths, bridges and iptables.\nAimed at developers rather than network engineers, Weave Net tries to be self-configuring and\nfind the best available transport between nodes. The control plane operates via gossip,\nwith no central point of control.</p>",
