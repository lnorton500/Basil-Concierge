  "abstract": "As CoSP\u2019s accelerate their adoption of SDN and NFV technologies, the increased need for metrics, performance measurement and benchmarking becomes a focus, to ensure the continued delivery of \u201cbest in class\u201d services. As NFV environments have grown in size and complexity, the tools required to gain this greater visibility into the NFVi need to continue to evolve to meet the requirements for manageability, serviceability and resiliency.\n\nUsing Collectd as a metrics collection tool, OPNFV Barometer monitors the performance of the NFVi resources and has the capability to expose these insights via open industry standard interfaces to analytics or MANO components for potential enforcement or corrective actions.  Barometer works with related open source technologies and communities (collectd, DPDK, OpenStack, Prometheus, SAF, etc.) to provide numerous metrics and events that address various different use cases such as service healing, power optimization and ensuring application QoS.",
