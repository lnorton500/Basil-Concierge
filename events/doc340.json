  "description": "Collabora has been working to provide a good user-experience for Collabora\nOnline - bringing LibreOffice to the web, and a particularly\nchallenging aspect of this has been copy/paste. One of our challenges\nis that by design we keep our document data on the server, which is at\nthe end of an asynchronous web-socket. Another challenge is the\nimpossibly baroque and arguably mis-designed set of clipboard APIs\nthat we have to work with.\n\nHear a story of how we defeated the issues, as well as the somewhat\nsad UX compromises we were forced to make for the hard cases.",
