  "description": "<p>OpenSIPS 3.0 embraces the cloud movement with open arms and aims to be easier to deploy and\na lot more enjoyable to maintain.  You can now automate routing logic updates to hundreds of\ninstances with a single click, thanks to the long-awaited ability to reload the routing script which\nis finally here!</p>\n\n<p>Individual running instances of OpenSIPS 3.0 are now capable of automatically upscaling or downscaling\nthemselves according to the volume of traffic that is running through them.  By auto-forking more SIP\nworker processes during peak day hours and un-forking them at night, OpenSIPS 3.0 maintains steady\nperformance while minimizing the costs of the cloud instances which host it.</p>\n\n<p>Say goodbye to \"opensipsctl\" and meet the new Python3-based tool for managing 3.x instances:\n\"opensips-cli\".  While retaining the majority of features of its predecessor, opensips-cli builds\nupon them, adding an intuitive way of interacting with multiple instances, the ability to filter, trace\nand troubleshoot specific calls which take place on any of them or to ask for an instance\ndiagnosis, which will instantly pinpoint issues such as insufficient memory, slow SQL/NoSQL service,\nslow DNS service, overflowing UDP queues and many more!</p>\n\n<p>Presented by Liviu Chircu and <a href=\"https://archive.fosdem.org/2019/schedule/speaker/razvan_crainea/\">R\u0103zvan Crainea</a></p>",
