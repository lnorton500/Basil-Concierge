  "description": "<p>Functional testing of printed circuit boards (PCB) is typically done with a bed of nails fixture. The fixture holds the PCB in place over spring-loaded probes that make contact with the board\u2019s test points.\nThe probes can be connected to an acquisition system that runs functional tests and to a programmer that flashes production firmware.\nThe Internet has tutorials and DIY kits suitable for PCBs with large test points (on a 2.54 mm grid). However as PCBs get smaller and more crowded, test points have to be smaller and closer to each other.\nThe goal of this talk is to describe how to build a test fixture with tighter requirements (test points with 0.6 mm diameter and 1.27 mm spacing) on a tight budget.</p>\n\n<p>Main talking points:\n- Making a PCB (with Kicad) to hold the probes in place and align the device under test (DUT),\n- Using a Raspberry Pi Zero to instrument the setup and communicate with the DUT,\n- Running OpenOCD on the Raspberry Pi Zero to flash the production firmware.</p>",
