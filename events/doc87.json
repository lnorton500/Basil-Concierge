In doing the audit, we found several areas of code that we wanted to improve and have been making continuous improvements ever since.  We've taken ideas and contributions from the OSS community, and have built a Performance Lab that helps \"lock in\" our improvements by continuously measuring the metrics that are important to us.</p>\n\n<p>We'll discuss how we performed the audit, some of the improvements we've made, how we're testing and validating our changes, and the real-time telemetry we capture on our library to ensure we're having as little of an impact as possible on the sites we're included on.</p>",
