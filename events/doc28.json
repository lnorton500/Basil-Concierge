  "abstract": "<p>Disk encryption is essential for physical computer security, but seldom used due to the trouble of remembering and typing a password at every restart. We describe Mandos, a program which solves this problem, its security model, and the underlying concepts of its design, as well as its evolution over the 10 years since its initial release.</p>",
  "description": "<p>Any security system must have a clear view of its intended threat model \u2013 i.e. what threats it is actually intended to protect against; the specific choices and tradeoffs made for Mandos will be explained. Another danger of security system design is the risk of its non-use; i.e. that the system will not be used for some real or perceived drawbacks, such as complexity. The deliberate design choices of Mandos, involving low-interaction, \u201cinvisible\u201d and automatic features, will be covered.  Special emphasis will be made on the many necessary changes made since the last FOSDEM talk in 2015.</p>",
