In those 3 minutes, they should briefly introduce the project, explain what design help they need, and provide contact details so designers can reach them after FOSDEM.\n\nThe Open Source Design collective will use the information to submit a \"job\" for each project to the Open Source Design \"jobs board\" (https://opensourcedesign.net/jobs/), so that the request for design help reaches not just the designers in the room, but also the wider design community.",
