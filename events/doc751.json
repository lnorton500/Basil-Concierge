  "abstract": "There is some combination of a turf war and a diaspora happening in the open source communities I participate in. There are synchronous and async channels galore. Every one of them has fans and haters with firmly held opinions on how it's the best or worst thing in the world.\n\nLet's take a step back and take a look at the landscape together. What are our communities searching for when they hop into communication channels? How do we meet new members where they are comfortable in order to be more welcoming?\n\nAs a self-defined GitHub generation of open source enthusiast, I'd like to start a conversation from my personal experience and then jump into research on the options available to us today. I hope we can leave with a view of the world spanning across channels with a focus on our contributors.",
