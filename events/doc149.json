  "abstract": "<p>Farwest is an Erlang framework for building RESTful Web applications and APIs.</p>\n\n<p>Well written Farwest applications apply the HATEOAS principles and as a result can be interacted with using a single client. This removes entirely the need to write a separate client per API and lets servers decide how the data is best consumed by everyone.</p>\n\n<p>This demo will show how to use Farwest to write a simple API to a document oriented database.</p>",
