  "abstract": "Farwest is an Erlang framework for building RESTful Web applications and APIs.\n\nWell written Farwest applications apply the HATEOAS principles and as a result can be interacted with using a single client. This removes entirely the need to write a separate client per API and lets servers decide how the data is best consumed by everyone.\n\nThis demo will show how to use Farwest to write a simple API to a document oriented database.",
