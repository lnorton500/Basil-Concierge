Apparently, not every developer, application or organization is ready for Kubernetes\u2026\n\nIn this presentation we will share a real world use case: deploying and configuring a brand new natural history museum. We\u2019ll show how we built the museum with open source software and config management tools, dealing with a broad set of technologies, a tight schedule, a sector dominated by traditional organizations fixated on proprietary solutions and a whole bunch of actual fossils. We\u2019ll show how far we\u2019ve come, and what choices we made along the way.\n\nCheck out this talk if you want to see how Ansible, MAAS, PlatformIO, Nextcloud and other tools were used to not just automatically deploy and configure Linux based media players, games and digital signage screens, but also to manage Cumulus Linux-based switches, OPNsense firewalls, show controllers, Arduino microcontrollers, KNX gateways, projectors and even the odd OSX machine.",
