Although it\u2019s made a great impact on Android, it\u2019s equally good on the server side. As Domain-Specific Languages are constrained by the language they run on, Kotlin frees developers from Java fluent builders to propose something better.</p>\n\n<p>Using the Vaadin web framework as an example, I\u2019ll demo how one could design its own DSL with Kotlin.</p>",
