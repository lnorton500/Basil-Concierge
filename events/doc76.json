  "abstract": "While userspace networking has demonstrated great performance benefits, it does come with greater complexity than kernel networking.\n\nIn parallel, Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) was developed as an efficient way to move data in HPC and storage clusters with great success.\n\nKey properties of this technology are also highly desirable for userspace networking: native integration with the operating system (OS), OS bypass and a very efficient software interface.\nRDMA-capable network adapters are now enabling standard Ethernet networking functions through the RDMA interface, allowing userspace networking software such as VPP to achieve extreme performance while integrating transparently with the OS.\n\nWe'll present:\n\n\nthe RDMA Ethernet concepts, architecture and interfaces\nhow VPP leverages it\nthe problems solved by this architecture and the usecase it enables\n",
