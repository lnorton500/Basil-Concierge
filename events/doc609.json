  "abstract": "<p>rav1e is a fast AV1 encoder written in rust (and plenty of assembly), released monthly.</p>\n\n<p>Since the 0.1.0 release we try to make sure we provide an adequate speed or quality boost compared to the previous.</p>\n\n<p>This talk is about what tools are available in the rust ecosystem and what are the practices that worked best for us.</p>",
  "description": "<p>The presentation will touch the following topics:\n- Exploring a codebase and profiling it effectively, both for cpu usage and memory usage.\n- Which are the optimization strategies that worked for us better (critical path analysis vs peak consumer)\n- Benchmarking and tracing</p>\n\n<p>I'll provide examples on what tools worked well or not so well and what currently I consider the best and most promising tools for each tasks.</p>",
