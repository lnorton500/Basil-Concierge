  "abstract": "The DSpace community is anticipating the largest release ever in 2020 with DSpace 7 ( https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Release+7.0+Status ). The platform is used in thousands of research institutions around the globe and powers systems including dspace.mit.edu, dash.harvard.edu and openknowledge.worldbank.org. If you download an academic paper through Google Scholar today, the chance is large that it is served to you thanks to a DSpace institutional repository.\n\nThe talk aims to briefly introduce the scope and usage of the DSpace software. Attendees will learn how the governance of the DSpace community is structured, and what lead to the decision to drop the two legacy UIs, JSPUI and XMLUI, in favour of an endeavour to introduce Angular as the new UI layer.\n\nThe most relevant piece of the presentation for the Fosdem audience, will be an outline of the tooling and best practices applied in the community, together with a pro and con evaluation.\n\nWe are very keen on learning from other participants in the audience what they could advise, both on a technical and organisational level, going forward.\n\n<h2>Previous presentations on DSpace 7</h2>\n\n<a href=\"https://lecture2go.uni-hamburg.de/l2go/-/get/v/24819\">Introducing DSpace 7</a>\n<a href=\"https://lecture2go.uni-hamburg.de/l2go/-/get/v/24831\">DSpace 7 Configurable Entities</a>\n<a href=\"https://lecture2go.uni-hamburg.de/l2go/-/get/v/24820\">The DSpace 7 Angular UI from a user perspective</a>",
