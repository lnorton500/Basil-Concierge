I will outline opportunities and challenges for implementing CI processes for hardware.\n\nWith PSlab apart from the firmware we have connected CI processes to our hardware repository. This means each design change can be automatically build into a digital prototype. Electronics materials are largely standardized and with KiCad we are even able to create package lists and Gerber files automatically. Furthermore we deploy to Kitspace using a yaml file. Here any user can order all components and the board through a one-click process. Every version could easily be built here.",
