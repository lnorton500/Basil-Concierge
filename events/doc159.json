  "description": "<p>Graph algorithms play an increasingly important role in real-world applications. Use-cases that we see in the wild are related to fraud detection, fraud detection, retail recommendation and identifying influencers for marketing campaigns. The Neo4j Graph Algorithms library contains a set of ~50 graph algorithms covering the above-mentioned problem domains.</p>\n\n<p>Running a graph algorithm in Neo4j involves three essential steps: loading the graph from the database in an optimized in-memory format, executing the algorithm, and streaming or writing of results. For the user, these steps are hidden behind single procedure calls, integrated in the Cypher query language.</p>\n\n<p>In our talk, we will explain and demonstrate what happens in the system when a user calls an algorithm procedure. This involves scanning Neo4j store files, constructing our in-memory graph representation and executing an algorithm via our Java Graph API.</p>\n\n<p>Attendees will learn how to setup and use the Neo4j Graph Algorithms Library. Furthermore, they will get a good understanding of how the library works internally and how to tune it for specific use-cases.</p>",
