  "description": "<p>MDB -- the debugger on Solaris -- has a feature called \"walkers\" that is used to great effect when inspecting the contents of large data structures in the Solaris Kernel.</p>\n\n<p>We introduce a GDB plugin to provide the same type of functionality.</p>\n\n<p>Similar to Unix pipelines, one can now flexibly write a surprisingly powerful command by combining several \"walkers\".</p>\n\n<p>Some examples are:\n- Search an inferior data structure for nodes that are malformed.</p>\n\n<pre><code> gdb-pipe &lt;mywalker&gt; &lt;startnode&gt; | if ! &lt;some verification test&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Put breakpoints on member functions of those nodes in a data structure matching some criteria.\n   gdb-pipe &lt;mywalker> &lt;startnode> | if &lt;interesting-check> | show break {}->function-member</p></li>\n<li><p>Put breakpoints on a given function when passed a node that matches some criteria.\n   gdb-pipe &lt;mywalker> &lt;startnode> | if &lt;interesting-check> | show break somefunc if &lt;arg> == {}</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>This plugin has a strong aim to make it easy for users to write \"walkers\" over their own data structures, and already has \"walkers\" for the open source projects \"neovim\" and \"GCC\".</p>\n\n<p>We would like to discuss possible future directions for this plugin with regards to speed improvements to work on extremely large data structures, and how there could be a tie-in with pretty-printers.</p>",
