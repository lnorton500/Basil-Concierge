  "abstract": "<p>It is common knowledge that built-in asynchronous master-master (active-active) replication is not safe. I remember times when the official MySQL User Reference Manual stated that such an installation is not recommended for production use. Some experts repeat this claim even now.</p>\n\n<p>While this statement is generally true, I worked with thousands of shops that successfully avoided asynchronous replication limitations in active-active setups.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk, I will show how they did it, demonstrate situations when asynchronous master-master replication is the best possible high availability option and beats such solutions as Galera or InnoDB Clusters. I will also cover common mistakes, leading to disasters.</p>",
