  "description": "<p>Red Hat's CKI project uses GitLab CI to organize and track its pipelines, lint, patch, and build Linux kernels, and oversee testing. It also uses a number of supporting systems to discover kernel patches and commits, maintain hardware inventory, provision hardware and VMs, run tests, and finally record and report results.</p>\n\n<p>See which tricks the project is pulling to tie all these parts together, and test patches posted to several maillists, commits to 15+ git repos, builds done by other build systems, as well as weird things like stable kernel patch queue, and parts of its own software stack.</p>\n\n<p>Making such extensive use of a CI system inevitably uncovers its limitations, and a list of these will also be presented along with some possible solutions.</p>",
