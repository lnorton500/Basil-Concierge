  "description": "We live in exciting times. It was never so easy to design and produce electronic devices like today.\nThis really unleash people's creativity.\nThe Open Source Hardware movement helps people to study, modify, improve and share designs and knowledge.\nToday we have FOSS CAD tools like KiCad to design our electronic boards.\nThere are multiply choices to manufacture PCBs even in small quantity.\nThere are lot of places to source components at low cost.\nWe have possibility to setup small electronic assembly/production \"factory\" at our house for less than EUR 1000.\nI will try to explain every step from the design to final product:\n\n\nHow to design your product with KiCad\nHow to generate files for production\nWhere to order your PCBs\nWhere to source the components for the assembly\nHow to setup small \"factory\" at home at budget\nHow to certify your OSHW project at OSHWA.org\n\n\n\nand will demonstrate Do-It-Yourself oven, solder paste printer, manual pick and place tools which could be used for production.",
