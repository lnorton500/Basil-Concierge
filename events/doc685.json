  "abstract": "JPEG 2000 was developed to replace the very successful JPEG standard, but it has instead\nremained a niche code. With recent updates to the standard speeding up decode by 10X, is\nworld domination around the corner ? This talk will describe many of the sophisticated features\nthat JPEG 2000 offers, and discuss why a 20 year old standard may be the codec of the\nfuture.",
  "description": "Released in 2000 as a potential replacement for the wildly successful JPEG standard, JPEG 2000 is a versatile codec with many sophisticated features including:\n\n<pre><code>Superior compression at low bit rates\nStorage of multiple resolutions in a single bitstream\nPrecise rate control without re-compression\nLossy and losssless compression\nProgression by resolution, component, spatial region or quality\n</code></pre>\n\nIt is an essential codec in medical imaging, digital cinema and remote sensing. However, due to its high complexity,\nit has remained a niche codec that never gained the popularity of its predecessor.\n\nAll of this is about to change with the recently released High Throughput JPEG 2000 standard that speeds up the codec by up to 10x,\nwhile leaving almost all of its features intact. This will propel it into the mainstream, particularly in broadcast and digital cinema.\n\nI will talk about the history of JPEG 2000, give an overview of its features and discuss the upcoming changes.\nI will also talk about current and planned GStreamer support for JPEG 2000.",
