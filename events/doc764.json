  "abstract": "<p>Innersource is a growing phenomenon that is widely viewed as improvement over existing regimes of proprietary silos within for-profit corporate walls. The bargain it strikes is compelling but curious: developers yield benefits that please them regarding software sharing &amp; improvement, while companies succeed in keeping their software crown jewels locked up &amp; locked down.\n How will that impact software freedom? Will it increase or decrease upstream contribution?  Will developers use Innersource as a jumping ground to FLOSS contribution, or will silos stay siloed?   What can Open Source Program Offices do to mitigate downsides to Innersource in an effort to increase FOSS-curious employee retention and interest? This talk explores these issues.</p>",
