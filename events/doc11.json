  "abstract": "Free Software (as in Freedom) had won. The vertically integrated Cloud now is the predominant operational paradigm and is threatening to undermine software freedom. To many all seems lost, but the world keeps changing and decentralized compute is making a comeback. Containers and Kubernetes are already having a deep impact on the Linux operating system (OS) that goes well beyond DevOps and cloud-native applications. The concepts of application-centric packaging, process isolation through Linux containers, and immutable infrastructure are shaking up the core traditions of today's GNU/Linux operating systems. These concepts are also challenging the assumptions and approaches derived from the past 40+ years of work that originated with UNIX. The Linux distribution as we know it is coming to an end, and is being replaced by a new concept of containerized, multi-instance, multi-user applications, which can be deployed in scale-out environments as well as for widely distributed compute scenarios. In this session, we'll assess this new OS environment in the times of '5G' de-centralized cloud and take a deep look at the consequences this new OS model has for both developers and admins.",
  "description": "This talk will draw on the history of compute in general and Free and Open Source in specific to explain an evolution of paradigms from the GNU/Linux Distribution to modern Free Software application plattforms build on Kubernetes and how they can shape the future of compute in the face of major technological changes.",
