  "description": "Ada is a feature-rich language, but what really makes Ada stand-out is\nthat the features are nicely integrated towards serving the goals of\nsoftware engineering.  If you prefer to spend your time on designing\nelegant solutions rather than on low-level debugging, if you think\nthat software should not fail, if you like to build programs from\nreadily available components that you can trust, you should really\nconsider Ada",
