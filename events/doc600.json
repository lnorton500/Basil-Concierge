  "title": "Introducing libeconf",
  "subtitle": "Bringing systemd-like configuration layering to everything else",
  "track": "Distributions",
  "abstract": "<p>systemD has a very distribution-friendly way of providing it's configuration, with distributions providing defaults in /usr and users being able to override things either selectively or entirely with their own files in /etc.\nThis is especially nice for distributions wishing to be in some way stateless, support a read-only root filesystem, or provide some kind of factory-reset.\nlibeconf is a newly written C library to ease the adoption of similar configuration layering in other programs across the Linux ecosystem.</p>",
  "description": "<p>This talk will give a brief introduction to libeconf, how to use it in your existing programs and demonstrate some examples that have already adopted libeconf (eg. PAM, util-linux, rebootmgr, etc).</p>\n\n<p>The session will also share some future plans and welcome suggestions for future contributions, especially for additional features, language bindings, etc.</p>\n\n<p>The target audience is primarily developers of 'low level' distribution plumbing (eg. core daemons &amp; services, package managers, etc) that are most likely to benefit from libeconf, but might be of interest to anyone developing any service for linux distributions.</p>",
