  "abstract": "I present \"Bach.java\" - a lightweight build tool for Java. Bach.java uses jshell/java to build\nmodular Java projects. It supports a \"zero installation\" run mode, convention over configuration\npragmatism, simple properties file to tweak defaults, and an API to build custom projects.\n\nIn the spirit of R\u00e9mix Forax, who wrote: \"No need to be a maven to be able to use a build tool\",\nBach.java is targeted to coders of small to mid-size Java projects, who want to focus on their\nideas and modules instead of learning and taming a build tool.",
