With CryptPad, the cloud hoster cannot read your data and if data leaks, hackers only get encrypted data which they cannot read without the keys.\n\nStart ditching proprietary privacy invading cloud services for an free software privacy protecting alternative.\n\nCome join the 20000 weekly users of the cryptpad.fr main instance and the 300 other instances available, including the German Pirate Party and C3 Wien instances.\n\nCome join us restoring our privacy.",
