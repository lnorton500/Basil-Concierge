Through the process of building a hand game robot which can play rock paper scissors with human beings, this talk aims to show you the possibility of using Kotlin to control GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi and other experiments such as performing machine learning operations in Kotlin using TensorFlow backend, thanks to the interoperability with C libraries.</p>",
