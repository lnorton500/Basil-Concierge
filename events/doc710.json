  "subtitle": "Practical examples and best practices on how to leverage systemd and D-Bus in Go",
  "track": "Go",
  "abstract": "<p>Systemd is a de-facto standard process manager in all mainstream Linux distributions for almost a decade.\nD-Bus is most widely used inter-process communication on a local host. It's used in many core apps on Linux Desktop.</p>\n\n<p>Yet both systemd and D-Bus are undervalued.\nVery often, programs that are only intended to run on Linux attempt to re-implement (with bugs) what systemd and D-Bus already provide\n(for example: watchdog function, reliable process termination, notifying another program about some event, coordination between multiple processes).</p>\n\n<p>The goal of this talk is to shift perspective on systemd and D-Bus (using concrete practical examples in Go),\nand show how basic building block these systems provide can be re-used in software you write for modern Linux system.</p>",
  "description": "<p>This is an exploratory talk. Then intent is to look at systemd and DBUS from a different angle.</p>\n\n<p>Most of current tutorials about systemd focused on operating a service like apache, nginx or redis.\nD-Bus tutorials are very abstract, basic and lack any concrete useful use-cases.</p>\n\n<p>I plan to present few recent additions to systemd, such as portable services and resource control.\nAs well as re-introduce few existing concepts, like sd-notify, watchdogs and transient units.</p>\n\n<p>On D-Bus I plan to show how to use bus abstraction and few neat features,\nlike passing file descriptors and receiving notifications.</p>\n\n<p>The focus is on how to not re-invent things that systemd and D-Bus do much better.</p>\n\n<p>Examples are given as a few simple Golang programs, with full source available on https://github.com/lvsl/tutorial-go-systemd-dbus.</p>\n\n<p>The indented audience is anyone who write and operate Go code on Linux.\nPreferred experience of the audience: basic knowledge of Linux and Golang, familiarity with systemd and D-Bus concepts would be useful as well.</p>",
