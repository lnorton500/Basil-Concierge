  "abstract": "<p>In the Ada world we typically write mission critical software that\njust has to work, but in a way one could argue that a lot more software\nis mission critical than is usually admitted.</p>\n\n<p>What does it take to actually perform rapid application development\nin any language?  Can we do it in Ada and why would we do so?</p>",
  "description": "<p>A quick look into some language features that can be [ab]used for\nenabling quick development of 'just a prototype' - which, as practice\nshows is often deployed into production, usually without proper\nquality controls and predictable outcome.</p>",
