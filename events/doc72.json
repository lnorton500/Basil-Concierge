  "description": "Launched in 2018, Akraino Edge Stack aims to create an open source software stack that supports high-availability cloud services optimized for edge computing systems and applications.\n\nAs part of the Akraino project, Kubernetes-Native-Infrastructure blueprint family represents the reference edge stack managed as a declarative platform, where controllers monitor a system for deviations between the user-declared target state and reality and take corrective\nactions to reconcile reality with the declared target state.\n\nKNI blueprints cover up two different use cases:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Provider Access Edge: as part of the network transformation, telco operators are moving to run its radio access network in a cloud-native manner. Technologies like vRAN will be only possible with a declarative approach, and leveraging open networking best practices.</li>\n<li>Industrial Edge: workloads such IoT, AI/ML, AR/VR, and ultra-low latency control will be run in the edge. These workloads will require specific hardware such GPUs and FPGAs. KNI can show how this needs can be a reality today.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\nWith Kubernetes Native Infrastructure learn about the k8s way of managing infrastructure. By defining a declarative state, the edge administrator will be able to manage thousands of sites by following an innovative GitOps approach.\n\nIf you are interested in these exciting topics, don't miss the talk!",
