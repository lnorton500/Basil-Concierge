Biodiversity museum Naturalis has decided to present most of their interactive content using open source software. In this presentation we talk about our experiences with mpv as the go to tool for a diverse selection of media setups in our brand new museum and how we made it work with show controllers, Arduino devices and open source content and config management tools.</p>",
