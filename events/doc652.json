  "description": "In this talk you'll learn how the Firefox team changed how we ship new features in the browser, and adopted industry best practices including gradual deployments and feature flags.\n\nWhy?\n\n\nListening to our most vocal users may bias us towards the needs of an unrepresentative group of users\nWhen you release a browser to millions of users on a heterogeneous set of platforms, you're testing in production\nAvoiding dot releases\n\n\n\nI'll talk about what we learned and how it's shaped how we release Firefox at Mozilla.",
