  "abstract": "<p>LAVA is an automated validation architecture primarily aimed at testing deployments of systems based around the Linux kernel on ARM devices, specifically ARMv7 and later.\nLAVA is becoming the de facto standard to test software (bootloader, kernel, userspace) on development boards (rpi, juno, beagle, ...). It's used by many projects to build large testing systems like kernelci.</p>\n\n<p>Testing a testing system like LAVA is sometimes a tricky task. In order to test LAVA we had to develop some specific tools (meta-lava, DummySYS, lavafed, ...) that I will present during this talk.</p>",
