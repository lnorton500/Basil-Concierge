  "abstract": "Since 2016, the UK Government has been running an open-source, cross-government Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) to make it easier and cheaper to build government services. The GOV.UK PaaS is built on BOSH and Cloud Foundry, and is deployed using Concourse.\n\nConcourse is \"an open-source continuous thing-doer\", with abstractions that help build pipelines quickly, and for extending the behaviour of the system.\n\nThis presentation will provide an introduction to Concourse, and then describe how the GOV.UK PaaS team use Concourse to continuously deploy a whole PaaS whilst ensuring high-availability and minimal impact to services and users.",
