  "abstract": "This talk presents current capabilities of Grafana to integrate metrics, logs and traces and shows how to setup both Grafana and application code to be able to correlate all 3 in Grafana. It assumes some familiarity with Grafana to follow the How To steps but should be suitable for beginner users. Afterwards it shows future direction of Grafana in context of \"Experiences\", for even more seamless experience when correlating data from multiple data sources.",
