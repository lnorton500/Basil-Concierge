  "abstract": "<p>Even though the IoT buzz has been around for years, ecosystems are still scattered and developers must usually patch together a number of solutions to achieve their goals. Astarte is a free software, opinionated \"blackbox\" solution which aims at empowering developers with a platform which puts Data as the first-class citizen rather than focusing on Device-to-Cloud communication, and can scale to production-tier deployments easily.</p>",
  "description": "<p>Astarte enables developers to skip the details of all the plumbing in IoT data collection, and skip straight to easy-to-use mechanisms for harnessing data produced by IoT devices through analytics, AI, or simply visualisation.\nThe talk will go over Astarte's design and architecture, both from a plumbing perspective and from the daily developer usage. The live demo will show how to install Astarte in a Kubernetes Cluster, set up a Device (real or a simulator) to interact with Astarte, and build a minimal web application to interact with it - all in the timespan of the talk.</p>",
