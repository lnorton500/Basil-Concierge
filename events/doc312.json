  "abstract": "<p>This is a hands-on short tutorial on how to write your own estimator or transformer\nwhich can be used in a scikit-learn pipeline, and works seamlessly with the other\nmeta-estimators of the library.</p>\n\n<p>It also includes how they can be conveniently tested with a simple set of tests.</p>",
  "description": "<p>In many data science related tasks, the use-case specific requirements require us to\nslightly manipulate the behavior of some of the estimators or transformers present\nin scikit-learn. Some of the tips and requirements are not necessarily well documented\nby the library, and it can be cumbersome to find those details.</p>\n\n<p>In this short tutorial, we go through an example of writing our own estimator,\ntest it against the scikit-learn's common tests, and see how it behaves inside\na pipeline and a grid search.</p>\n\n<p>There has also been recent developments related to the general API of the estimators\nwhich require slight modifications by the third party developers. I will cover these\nchanges and point you to the activities to watch as well as some of the private utilities\nwhich you can use to improve your experience of developing an estimator.</p>\n\n<p>The materials of the talk will be available on github as a jupyter notebook.</p>",
