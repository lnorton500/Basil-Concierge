  "abstract": "To run our software we need a flow of data going through it. Usually we write scripting pieces to make that workflow of data moving from one component to the next. Integration Processes are the \"glue\" between these software pieces. Automating the data flows, adding conditional steps, handling credentials on a secure way,... That's usually a tedious and repetitive task lots of developers do again and again. With Integration Processes frameworks we can make it simpler and reuse expertise from other developers. We could even build entire workflows without throwing a single line of code.",
