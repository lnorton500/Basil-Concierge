  "abstract": "<p>Advene is a video annotation platform (free software) that aims at accompanying scholars in their audiovisual analyses workflow. It promotes flexible and evolving annotation structures and interfaces in order to deal with the inherent dynamic nature of analysis. In this presentation, I will present the platform itself, and illustrate its usage through existing Digital Humanities projects that use it, from structuring videos for interview analyses to implementing a workflow for semantic annotation of movies.</p>",
