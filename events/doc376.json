We\ndiscover how Podman fits into the containers ecosystem, learn about the\narchitecture behind the project and utilize practical examples for daily\ndevelopment tasks.</p>\n\n<p>For example, we will learn how rootless containers work technically, how to\nsafely share resources within multiple containers and which benefits a\ndaemon-less container management tool like Podman provides. All these exciting\nfeatures will be explained by utilizing live demos which leaves room for an open\ndiscussion at the end of the talk.</p>",
