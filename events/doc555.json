  "abstract": "Mgmt is a next gen config management tool that takes a fresh look at existing automation problems.\nThe tool has two main parts: the engine, and the language.\nThis presentation will have a large number of demos of the language.\nThe language is a minimalistic, functional, reactive DSL.\nIt was designed to both constrain the user with safe types, and no core looping constructs, but also to empower the user to build powerful real-time distributed systems.\nThis year we will expand on last years talk by showing more of the core language features like classes, functions, closures and more!\nFinally we'll talk about some of the future designs we're planning and make it easy for new users to get involved and help shape the project.",
