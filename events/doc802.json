In this talk I will guide you though the extensions: how to read the labels? How to cook some common recipes? I will also show some exotic but nice ingredients. And last but not least: we will be having some protocol-fun!",
  "description": "The eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol, XMPP, has extensibility at its core. It is because of the extensibility that there is a vivid XMPP ecosystem: it is easy to adapt XMPP to new developments and to new use cases. The XMPP Standards Foundation maintains a list of extensions to XMPP. In this talk I will dive into this list of extensions: what kind of extensions are there? What statuses can an extension have? What extensions to use in some common use cases? And I will touch some exotic extensions for use cases you may never have thought about. Oh, and what is the story about these \u2018humorous\u2019 extensions, can a protocol be humorous?",
