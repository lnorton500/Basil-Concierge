  "description": "Running a weird operating system comes at the cost of having to adjust software to run on it.\nGo is probably one of the hardest projects to adjust.\nDoing so required learning the guts of:\n- ARM64 calling conventions\n- signal handling\n- thread-local storage\n- a lot of Go-specifics\n\nWhich will be discussed in this lecture.",
