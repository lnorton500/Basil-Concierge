  "description": "Skydive is a toolbox to monitor, visualize and troubleshoot an infrastructure.\n\nIt first collects all the information about the physical and logical infrastructure : network interfaces, Linux and Openvswitch bridges, network namespaces, Docker/runc containers, Kubernetes objects, virtual machines and more. All these objects are stored into a graph to allow the operator to visualize and query the whole topology. On top of this, Skydive is able to inject, capture and analyze traffic at any point of this infrastructure - using various technics such as AFpacket, eBPF, DPDK or SFlow samples. This make possible use cases like :\n\n<pre><code>\u2022 troobleshoot dropped packets\n\n\u2022 get metrics and bandwidth about some specific traffic\n\n\u2022 trigger alert on some abnormal traffic detection\n\n\u2022 get latency on the whole path of a flow\n\n\u2022 and a lot more...\n</code></pre>\n\nSkydive is agnostic to any SDN, container orchestration engine or virtualization platform. That being said, Skydive has plugins for specific technologies such as Kubernetes/Istio, OpenStack, Openvswitch, Network Service Mesh, OpenContrail, VPP and more.\n\nThis presentation will present the architecture of Skydive and demonstrate some use cases through a demo.",
