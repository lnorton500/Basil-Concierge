  "abstract": "<p>The concept of home directories on Linux/UNIX has little changed in the last 39 years. It's time to have a closer look, and bring them up to today's standards, regarding encryption, storage, authentication, user records, and more.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk we'll talk about \"systemd-homed\", a new component for systemd, that reworks how we do home directories on Linux, adds strong encryption that makes sense, supports automatic enumeration and hot-plugged home directories and more.</p>",
