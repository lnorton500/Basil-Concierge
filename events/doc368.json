  "description": "<p>SREs automate every aspect of workload management. Applying this mentality to the Kubernetes space, a pattern has emerged for coding such automation directly into the control plane. By adding native extensions to the Kubernetes API that are tailored to individual workloads, the Operator pattern enables infrastructure and workloads to be managed side-by-side with one set of tooling and access control.</p>\n\n<p>Join us to learn why Operators are the leading and default approach for managing workloads on Kubernetes. We will pull back the curtain to show you exactly what an Operator is, how to make one, and what it means to be \u201cKubernetes Native\u201d. To close we will discuss use cases from the field; how real organizations have created and/or re-used Operators to automate their operations.</p>",
