  "track": "RISC-V",
  "abstract": "<p>HammerBlade is an open source RISC-V manycore that has been under development since 2015 and has already been silicon validated with a 511-core chip in 16nm TSMC. It features extensions to the RISC-V ISA that target GPU-competitive performance for parallel programs (i.e. GPGPU) including graphs and ML workloads. In this talk we will overview the components of the HW and software ecosystem in the latest version, and show you how to get up and running as an open source user or contributor in either SW or HW on Amazon F1 cloud FPGAs.</p>",
