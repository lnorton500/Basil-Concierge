You don\u2019t have (though you can) save program state to files.</p></li>\n<li><p>Managed code. Native Phantom applications are running in a bytecode machine. (But it is worth to mention that Phantom has simple Posix compatibility subsystem too.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Global address space. Phantom OS is an application server. All applications can communicate directly, by sharing objects.</p></li>\n<li><p>Phantom OS persistence is achieved not by serializing data to files, but by running all applications in a persistent RAM. You can (and it will be true) think of Phantom memory subsystem as of a persistent paging engine</p></li>\n</ul>",
