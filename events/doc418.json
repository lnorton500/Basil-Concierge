  "subtitle": "An embeddable, distributed and fault tolerant SQL engine",
  "track": "Databases",
  "abstract": "<p>SQLite has proven extremely successful at providing applications with a powerful, portable and embeddable SQL engine that can handle most of their data storage needs.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, SQLite is neither replicating nor fault tolerant. These two features are however very important for the rising Edge/IoT market: dqlite delivers both of them.</p>\n\n<p>dqlite is a C library which exposes a SQLite database over the network and replicates it using the Raft algorithm, with built-in automatic failover.</p>\n\n<p>It allows to build and operate a fault-tolerant cluster of nodes each running an instance of the user application.</p>\n\n<p>dqlite was created to support clustering in the LXD container management project, where it has been used for over a year. In this talk we will look at its design, implementation and various use cases.</p>",
  "description": "<p>Distributed systems are ubiquitous these days: we need to commoditize the underlying technologies and algorithms, making them easy to consume. The dqlite project offers application developers the opportunity to build on top of a storage engine which is as easy and convenient as a plain SQLite database, but also meets higher durability and fault tolerance requirements.</p>",
