  "abstract": "OCS stands for Openshift Container storage. It provides container-based storage for OCP(Openshift container platform). It\u2019s easily scalable to bare metal, VMs and cloud platforms.\nAuto healing is a property of OCS cluster that auto heals a cluster component automatically when passes through an unexpected condition. A component can be a node, a network interface, a service, etc. To make sure auto heals just fine, we introduced negative testing.\nNegative Testing is defined as, a testing type that checks a system for unexpected conditions. In this presentation, We\u2019re going to talk, what role negative testing plays, how to negative test components like node by shutting it down, deploying a heavy workload, etc. Similarly, for the network component, we are going to see what happens when the public network is disconnected along with many more scenarios.",
