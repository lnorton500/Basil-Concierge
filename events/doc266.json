  "abstract": "With Intel's Firmware Support Package (FSP) and the recent release of a\nredistributable firmware binary\nfor the Management Engine, it has become possible to share full firmware images\nfor modern x86 platforms and potentially audit the binaries. Yet, reverse\nengineering, decompilation and disassembly are still not permitted. However,\nthanks to previous research, we can have a closer look at the binary data and\ncome to a few conclusions. This talk briefly summarizes the fundamentals of\ndeveloping custom and open source firmware, followed by a quick guide through\nthe process of analyzing the binaries without actually violating the terms to\nunderstand a few bits, and finally poses a statement on the political issues\nthat researchers, repair technicians and software developers are facing\nnowadays, taking into account how consumers are affected and how they perceive\nthe situtation eventually.",
