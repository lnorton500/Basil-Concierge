  "abstract": "<p>Running applications in the Cloud has changed the way users develop and ship\ntheir code. Quite recently, the community has given rise to microservices-based\napproaches, towards solutions that follow the paradigm of Platform-, Software-,\nand Function-as-a-Service (PaaS, SaaS, and FaaS respectively).</p>\n\n<p>To accommodate user demands, while maintaining security and isolation, Cloud\nvendors have adopted a hybrid approach where user workloads are being executed\nin lightweight sandboxed environments, where micro-hypervisors provide the\nisolation and container-based images facilitate application deployment. As a\nresult, lighter virtualization stacks remains a key aspect to maximize\nperformance in a multi-tenant but isolated environment.</p>\n\n<p>To this end, we started experimenting with various Virtual Machine Monitors\n(VMMs) that could provide the ideal trade-off between performance, flexibility\nand application portability. In this talk, we present the design of a minimal\nVMM, based on KVM, residing entirely in the Linux Kernel and showcase the\nmerits and shortcomings (minimal footprint, security concerns), for each\nuse-case (Cloud FaaS, edge multi-tenancy). Additionally, we present our\nexperience from porting Firecracker to a low-power device (RPi4) demonstrating\nthe merits of lightweight hypervisor stacks for flexible application execution\nat the edge.</p>",
