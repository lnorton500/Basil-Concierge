  "description": "<p>Mozilla's WebThing schemas specify many IoT devices. They are also flexible enough to describe any devices using generic types. Standalone devices can be interacted with using WebThings REST API or using the Mozilla gateway. The gateway is designed to be extensible using addon adapters. A couple of my contributions involving sensors and virtual things will be demonstrated. Recipes will be shared to build your own adapters using your favorite language (Js, Python, etc). The addons can easily be deployed on your RaspberryPi for self-hosted home automation.</p>",
