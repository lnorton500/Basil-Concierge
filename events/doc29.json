  "abstract": "<p>In this talk we will show you, practical, hands on, how you can secure your application, a small user community or environment using industry best of breed security, fully self-supporting and  <em>without</em> having to rely on a central certificate authority, big-tech or other central powerhouses. As devolved &amp; federated, or as central as you want - you set the rules. Working for you, with your standard-issue iPhone, your router or your laptop out of the box.</p>\n\n<p>Project redwax produces industry best practice crypto in a small package. Available today. If you know how to install the apache webserver - you are almost there.</p>\n\n<p>Project Redwax lets you download,a set of easy to deploy simple tools that capture and hard code a lot of industry best practice and specialist PKI knowledge. So that they can be put into the hands of a much wider community than currently served by a few specialist industries. It provides a non centralised, interoperable, open standard, open source, fully federated trust network where participants are not required to ask permission and can be self sufficient.</p>\n\n<p>This presentation presents what is available <em>today</em> and our plans on how to take this further, to engage with the wider open source community that together we can support individuals, organisations and (small) companies to get best of breed, distributed, peer to peer, security, confidentiality and privacy without having to rely on central infrastructures.</p>",
  "description": "<p>Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to be able to trust your own environment without having to trust a corporation or government? Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to take the sting out of certificate management?</p>\n\n<p>With some hands on examples we introduce the audience to the advantages of running your own certificate authority for security IOT in and around your home and establishing a trusted channel for exchanging information with your friends.</p>\n\n<p>This project (and code) helps you to decentralize trust management so that the values security, confidentiality and privacy can be upheld in public infrastructure and private interactions. We strengthen the existing technologies and infrastructure by providing a modular, very simple and foremost practical set of tools to manage public key based trust infrastructures as currently used.</p>\n\n<p>Project Redwax lets you download, a set of easy to deploy simple tools that capture and hard code a lot of industry best practice and specialist PKI knowledge.

And the good news - it is simple - if you know how to install the Apache Webserver - you are almost there. We are working with the unix/linux community to get the code in standard distro\u2019s and cloud init scripts so that these capabilities are made available to wider community of application developers.</p>\n\n<p>This presentation presents what is available <em>today</em> and our plans on how to take this further, to engage with the wider open source community that together we can support individuals, organisations and (small) companies to get best of breed, distributed, peer to peer, security, confidentiality and privacy without having to rely on central infrastructures, rare knowledge or big interests.</p>\n\n<p>Speaker:        Dirk-Willem van Gulik (Dirkx@apache.org)\nTalk:           50 minutes.\nTravel support:     not needed\nLanguage:               English</p>\n\n<p>BIO\nDirk-Willem van Gulik?</p>\n\n<p>During the startup-years - Dirk-Willem van Gulik helped shape the world-wide-web.
