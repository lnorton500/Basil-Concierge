  "abstract": "<p>The <em>Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware</em> software community obviously uses Tiki itself for collaboration and knowledge management.\nYet, many other software tools or infrastructures are used. I will review and explain how and why.</p>",
  "description": "<p><em>Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware</em> was initially released in 2002 and is still very much alive with a vibrant community.\nWe obviously want to use Tiki itself for collaboration and knowledge management as much as possible, but the real situation is, we use a lot more tools.\nWe leverage the fact that Tiki is part of wikisuite by using the other wikisuite software, but these still don't cover everything we use.\nThe reasons vary from old habits to convenience or improved efficiency and they are different for each collaboration tool.\nI will review them and explain why we use them and how useful they are to us. Also, I will mention our plans for the future.</p>",
