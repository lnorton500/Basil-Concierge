  "subtitle": "Coming to your cloud with XDP, AVF, and Kubernetes integration",
  "track": "Software Defined Networking",
  "abstract": "<p>Vita is a high-performance IPsec VPN gateway designed with medium and large network operators in mind. It is written in a high-level language (Lua) using the Snabb networking toolkit and achieves high performance via networking in userspace, i.e. bypassing the kernel network stack.</p>\n\n<p>This talk will discuss Vita and how it was developed using Snabb. Topics include: fast software networking using a dynamic, high-level language; cryptographic ciphers implemented in software software accelerated by x86 extensions; modern cryptography; limiting complexity; multi-core scaling; YANG enabled control planes; minimalist NIC drivers.</p>",
