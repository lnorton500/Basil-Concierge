This is exactly what the SQL:2011 standard and MariaDB 10.3+ are giving you. System versioned tables allow you to rewind time and see their content as it was in the past \u2014 all using normal SELECT statements.

It will present various new applications and use cases that became possible now. Having a time machine, what will you use it for?",
