PWAs equipped with service workers provide features like offline availability, push notifications etc. Now with modern webAPIs, PWAs are beyond the browsers; in Hardware. Consider turning bulb on/off with your PWA, sounds cool? Lets learn how to, in this talk!",
  "description": "PWAs have been limited to offline availability and push notifications for long time, I want to explain to developers there is much more to PWAs, I want to show how to interact with more device specific features with modern webAPIs like web Bluetooth, speech synthesis, speech recognition, webShare etc. With this talk I want to give attendees a compelling reason to develop PWA instead of a mobile app for there next thing. I plan to have a quick introduction to serviceworkers and then majorly explaining webAPIs, usage and implementation with demos.",
