  "description": "<p>Bring your open source game-related project (be it an engine, game, demo, tool, or something else) and showcase to our fellow gamedev friends. Talks should have at most five minutes with no time allotted for questions. If you want to bring a laptop to show something, keep it ready and install/uninstall it as fast as possible (will be part of your five minutes). Please be understanding so everyone can have a chance. Contact the room managers on the event day if you want to present something.</p>",
