  "description": "Over the previous months, openSUSE and SUSE teams have worked together on integrating latest GNOME release (3.34) in their various distributions, while minimizing duplicated work and sharing as much code as possible.\n\nWe'll describe how it was done for the 3 differents flavors of distributions:\n- openSUSE Tumbleweed (rolling release)\n- SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP2 (Enterprise release)\n- openSUSE Leap 15.2 (stable release)",
