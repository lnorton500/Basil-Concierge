Beneficial factors for such endeavors include the degree of interconnectedness, availability of low cost sensors, and advances in predictive analytics. This work presents a condition monitoring platform built entirely from open-source software. A real world industry example for an escalator use case from Deutsche Bahn underlines the advantages of this approach.",

Even with this high resolution knowledge about our equipment under supervision, sensitive alarming of our customers requires a system of systems approach taking into account up to several months of data.\n\nThis talk highlights the challenges and learnings involved in building the platform and high-level aggregation for our alarming system.",
