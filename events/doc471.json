It allows the execution, in the browser, of your favourite programming languages \u200b\u200bat almost native speed.</p>",
  "description": "<p>During this session, we browse the current means implemented by browsers to optimise the execution of JavaScript code. We will outline the limitations of current solutions, the benefits provided by the WebAssembly and review its performance.</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy the future of the Web, now!</p>",
