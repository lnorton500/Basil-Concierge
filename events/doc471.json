  "abstract": "The Web is omnipresent nowadays and meets most of the needs of our applications.\n\nFor almost 10 years, leading browsers have been working hard to push the boundaries and performance of our connected apps.\n\nThis is also the main reason why WebAssembly, the new binary standard initially implemented by Safari, Chrome, Firefox and Edge, appeared. It allows the execution, in the browser, of your favourite programming languages \u200b\u200bat almost native speed.",
