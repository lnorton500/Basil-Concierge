  "abstract": "Git-issue is a minimalist decentralized issue management system based on Git,\noffering (optional) biderectional integration with GitHub and GitLab issue management.\nIt has the following advantages over other systems.\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No backend, no dependencies:</strong>\nYou can install and use <em>git issue</em> with a single shell script.\nThere's no need for a server or a database back-end, and the corresponding\nproblems and requirements for their administration.</li>\n<li><strong>Decentralized asynchronous management:</strong>\nAnyone can add, comment, and edit issues without requiring online access\nto a centralized server.\nThere's no need for online connectivity; you can pull and push issues\nwhen you're online.</li>\n<li><strong>Transparent text file format:</strong>\nIssues are stored as simple text files, which you can view, edit, share, and\nbackup with any tool you like.\nThere's no risk of losing access to your issues because a server has\nfailed.</li>\n<li><strong>Git-based:</strong>\nIssues are changed and shared through Git.\nThis provides <em>git issue</em> with a robust, efficient, portable,\nand widely available infrastructure.\nIt allows you to reuse your Git credentials and infrastructure, allows\nthe efficient merging of work, and also provides a solid audit trail\nregarding any changes.\nYou can even use Git and command-line tools directly to make sophisticated\nchanges to your issue database.</li>\n</ul>",
