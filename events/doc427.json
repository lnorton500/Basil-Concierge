  "abstract": "Git-issue is a minimalist decentralized issue management system based on Git,\noffering (optional) biderectional integration with GitHub and GitLab issue management.\nIt has the following advantages over other systems.\n\n\nNo backend, no dependencies:\nYou can install and use git issue with a single shell script.\nThere's no need for a server or a database back-end, and the corresponding\nproblems and requirements for their administration.\nDecentralized asynchronous management:\nAnyone can add, comment, and edit issues without requiring online access\nto a centralized server.\nThere's no need for online connectivity; you can pull and push issues\nwhen you're online.\nTransparent text file format:\nIssues are stored as simple text files, which you can view, edit, share, and\nbackup with any tool you like.\nThere's no risk of losing access to your issues because a server has\nfailed.\nGit-based:\nIssues are changed and shared through Git.\nThis provides git issue with a robust, efficient, portable,\nand widely available infrastructure.\nIt allows you to reuse your Git credentials and infrastructure, allows\nthe efficient merging of work, and also provides a solid audit trail\nregarding any changes.\nYou can even use Git and command-line tools directly to make sophisticated\nchanges to your issue database.\n",
