In time, the pot framework has developed to provide features containers-alike.\nThe plugin interface provided by nomad (a container orchestrator), allowed us to develop a driver for pot, enabling nomad to orchestrate pot jails.\nIn this talk, we'd like to present this FreeBSD-based ambitious alternative to Docker-Kubernetes</p>",
