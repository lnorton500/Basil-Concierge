Instead of just signing the open letter, they picked up the phone and called their Public Policy team in Brussels. Two weeks later, we saw new text in the Parliament\u2019s version of the legal proposal.\n\nOFE therefore calls on everyone who cares about Free and Open Source Software, who works (or knows someone who works) at companies, across industrial verticals, to build relationships with your policy or government relations teams.\n\nThis is more important than ever, as there are new challenges and opportunities for FOSS on the horizon. Apart from promoting FOSS, we have to make sure that it never becomes an unintended victim again, as was the case with the first version of the EU\u2019s Copyright Directive. As we are entering the Age of Tech Regulation, we need to mature our advocacy to increase our effectiveness.",
