  "abstract": "In this talk we will give a brief introduction into the GNUnet peer-to-peer framework, its architecture and existing applications.\nThis includes details on the p2p overlay, double-ratchet messaging channels (CADET) the GNU Name System (GNS) and a selection of other applications and features.\nWe present the current status of the project, the roadmap as well as ways to participate and use GNUnet.",
  "description": "GNUnet is a new network protocol stack for building secure, distributed, and privacy-preserving applications. With strong roots in academic research, our goal is to replace the old insecure Internet protocol stack.\n\nGNUnet is typically run as an overlay network on top of the existing Internet infrastructure forming the basis of a hybrid peer-to-peer mesh and relay backbone for applications to run on. It could just as well be run independently of the Internet, over dedicated radio and cable.\n\nGNUnet is made for a free and open society: It's a self-organizing network and it is free software as in freedom. GNUnet puts you in control of your data. You determine which data to share with whom, and you're not pressured to accept compromises.",
