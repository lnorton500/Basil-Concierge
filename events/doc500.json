You will be\nable to back up VMs more efficiently, downloading only changed blocks.\nIncremental backup will be simpler and more reliable, not requiring\ncreating and deleting snapshots. Uploading will support on-the-fly\nconversion from raw to qcow2 when restoring disks.\n\nIn this talk we will travel into the future, introducing the oVirt\nincremental backup API for starting and ending backups, and the\novirt-imageio API for downloading changed blocks. Finally, we will travel\nback to the past, and show how to restore raw guest data into new disks.\n\nAudience:\nBackup vendors and virtualization developers, interested in utilizing\nincremental backup API. Also, oVirt administrators and users interested in\npeeking into the future of oVirt.\n\nSession summary:\nPeek into the future of oVirt backup API.",
