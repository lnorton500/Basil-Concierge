  "abstract": "Project Name: Data Analysis and statistical tool suite (GSoC 2017)\nThe primary goal of my project was to create OAT(Data analysis and statistics) extension in RESTFul Web API and OAT extension having data analysis and statistical tools for istSOS which is being used to automate the creation of statisticate documents using OAT library (FREEWAT) and harvesting the data from an istSOS server.\n\nProject Name:  istSOS - Support of unit of conversion in istsos3 (GSoC 2018)\nThe aim of my project primarily is to add plugins conversion of the unit of measure in istSOS3. The user can convert a unit in another specified unit. For Unit of measure conversion in istSOS3 we added postgresql-unit and pint libraries which has a powerful feature of unit conversion along with many specified functions like unit conversion function instantly and all types of operations support to istsos3.",
  "description": "Project Name: istSOS (OSGeo) - Data Analysis and statistical tool suite (GSoC 2017)\n\nThis section comprises of following parts:\n1. OAT installation\n2. Implemented OAT methods\n\nOAT is a Python package that is integrated in the FREEWAT environment through an interface exposing its features to modelers and non-programmer users. OAT library implements two main classes: the Sensor class that is designated to handle time\u00adseries data and metadata and the Method class which is designated to represent a processing method. The library applies the behavioral visitor pattern which allows the separation of an algorithm from the object on which it operates: thanks to this design pattern it is possible to add a new processing capability by simply extending the Method class without the need to modify the Sensor class. From a dependency point of view, OAT takes advantage of the PANDAS (McKinney, 2010), NUMPY and SCIPY (Van der Walt et. al. 2011) packages.\n\nProject Name:  istSOS (OSGeo) - Support of unit of conversion in istsos3 (GSoC 2018)\nThe aim of my project primarily is to add plugins conversion of the unit of measure in istSOS3.

For Unit of measure conversion in istSOS3 we added postgresql-unit and pint libraries which has a powerful feature of unit conversion along with many specified functions like unit conversion function instantly and all types operations supports to istsos3 data like add, subtraction, multiplication, and division with magnitude and units.",
