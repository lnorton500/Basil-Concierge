  "abstract": "For embedded developers using alternative programming languages, but also for anyone using third party driver frameworks such as libopencm3, one of the main pain points to start using a microcontroller is to make a Board Support Package.\n\nThings like linker script or startup code (crt0) not only require skills, but also information that are not always easily accessible.\n\nIn this talk we will present a tool that generates linker script, startup code, and low level hardware binding for 3000+ ARM microcontrollers using information extracted from archives provided as part of the ARM Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).",
