The new approach utilizes Kotlin Native to compile Kotlin language to native binaries for specific target platform which can run without a virtual machine. Thus enabling simplified code sharing across multiple platforms.\nIn this talk, you will be introduced to Kotlin/Native and demonstrate how to build a Kotlin Multiplatform app that runs on both iOS and Android using shared Kotlin code.",
